# AI-Based Student Emotion Engagement Detection

## About
This repository contains a project focused on detecting and analyzing student emotions and their engagement levels using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The goal is to develop models that can recognize emotional states and engagement from various inputs such as video frames, sensor data, or other sources.

## Features
- Emotion recognition model implementation
- Engagement level detection algorithms
- Data processing scripts and utilities
- Example usage with sample data files

## Technologies
- Python (100%)
- Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)
- Data processing libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas)
- Video frame extraction techniques

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Required libraries installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Installation
